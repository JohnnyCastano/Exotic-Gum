                    <h5>Johnny, Champ, and Andrew loved unique flavors and decided to create a website called "Exotic Gum".
                        They
                        spent months developing the perfect recipes for each flavor. They scoured the globe for the most
                        unusual and exciting flavors, from spicy cinnamon to fruity lychee. They sourced high-quality
                        ingredients and experimented with different recipes until they had created the perfect formulas
                        for
                        each flavor. They launched their website, and used social
                        media to build buzz. Soon, major retailers started stocking their gum, and their business grew.
                        As
                        their business continued to grow, the trio remained dedicated to their mission of bringing
                        unique
                        and exciting flavors to the world of gum. They
                        expanded their product line and became successful entrepreneurs, proud of their unique and
                        exciting

                <h2>Why we do it</h2>
                <h5>What we want is to promote cultural diversity and encourage people to explore new flavors and experiences. By offering a wide variety of unique and interesting gum flavors from different parts of the world, Exotic Gum can provide an opportunity for people to expand their palate and learn about different cultures and cuisines.

                    Additionally, creating exotic gum flavors is a way for us to promote creativity and innovation in the world of confectionery. By pushing the boundaries of what is traditionally considered "normal" for gum flavors, Exotic Gum can inspire other companies to take risks and experiment with new ideas in their own products.

                    Ultimately, the goal of creating a diverse range of gum flavors could be to bring people together through a shared love of interesting and exciting flavors. By providing a common ground for people to connect over their love of gum, Exotic Gum could promote a sense of community and unity among individuals from all walks of life, regardless of their cultural background or personal preferences.

                                Champ is a 16-year-old boy who keeps to himself and is often described as a "lone wolf".

Johnny is known for his impressive academic achievements and is often referred to as an "academic weapon". He excels in all his classes, except for one: chemistry.

Johnny struggles to understand chemistry and finds the subject boring and uninteresting. Despite his dislike for the subject, he's determined to maintain his excellent academic record and works hard to keep up his grades.

Sometimes, Johnny gets distracted by little things, like the sound of a pencil tapping or the rustling of papers. He finds it hard to concentrate when there are distractions around him, but he's working on improving his focus. Despite his academic and musical talents, Johnny is a humble and friendly person. He's well-liked by his peers and is known for his easygoing nature. Johnny is always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need and is a reliable and supportive friend.
